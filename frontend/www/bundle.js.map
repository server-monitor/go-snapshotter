For example, `Date` represents a value by returning a unix\n   * timestamp for `valueOf`:\n   *\n   *     var date1 = new Date(1234567890000); // Fri Feb 13 2009 ...\n   *     var date2 = new Date(1234567890000);\n   *     date1.valueOf(); // 1234567890000\n   *     assert( date1 !== date2 );\n   *     assert( Immutable.is( date1, date2 ) );\n   *\n   * Note: overriding `valueOf` may have other implications if you use this object\n   * where JavaScript expects a primitive, such as implicit string coercion.\n   *\n   * For more complex types, especially collections, implementing `valueOf` may\n   * not be performant. An alternative is to implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   * `equals` takes another object, presumably of similar type, and returns true\n   * if the it is equal. Equality is symmetrical, so the same result should be\n   * returned if this and the argument are flipped.\n   *\n   *     assert( a.equals(b) === b.equals(a) );\n   *\n   * `hashCode` returns a 32bit integer number representing the object which will\n   * be used to determine how to store the value object in a Map or Set. You must\n   * provide both or neither methods, one must not exist without the other.\n   *\n   * Also, an important relationship between these methods must be upheld: if two\n   * values are equal, they *must* return the same hashCode. If the values are not\n   * equal, they might have the same hashCode; this is called a hash collision,\n   * and while undesirable for performance reasons, it is acceptable.\n   *\n   *     if (a.equals(b)) {\n   *       assert( a.hashCode() === b.hashCode() );\n   *     }\n   *\n   * All Immutable collections implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   */\n  function is(valueA, valueB) {\n    if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n      return false;\n    }\n    if (typeof valueA.valueOf === 'function' &&\n        typeof valueB.valueOf === 'function') {\n      valueA = valueA.valueOf();\n      valueB = valueB.valueOf();\n      if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n        return true;\n      }\n      if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n        return false;\n      }\n    }\n    if (typeof valueA.equals === 'function' &&\n        typeof valueB.equals === 'function' &&\n        valueA.equals(valueB)) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  function deepEqual(a, b) {\n    if (a === b) {\n      return true;\n    }\n\n    if (\n      !isIterable(b) ||\n      a.size !== undefined && b.size !== undefined && a.size !== b.size ||\n      a.__hash !== undefined && b.__hash !== undefined && a.__hash !== b.__hash ||\n      isKeyed(a) !== isKeyed(b) ||\n      isIndexed(a) !== isIndexed(b) ||\n      isOrdered(a) !== isOrdered(b)\n    ) {\n      return false;\n    }\n\n    if (a.size === 0 && b.size === 0) {\n      return true;\n    }\n\n    var notAssociative = !isAssociative(a);\n\n    if (isOrdered(a)) {\n      var entries = a.entries();\n      return b.every(function(v, k)  {\n        var entry = entries.next().value;\n        return entry && is(entry[1], v) && (notAssociative || is(entry[0], k));\n      }) && entries.next().done;\n    }\n\n    var flipped = false;\n\n    if (a.size === undefined) {\n      if (b.size === undefined) {\n        if (typeof a.cacheResult === 'function') {\n          a.cacheResult();\n        }\n      } else {\n        flipped = true;\n        var _ = a;\n        a = b;\n        b = _;\n      }\n    }\n\n    var allEqual = true;\n    var bSize = b.__iterate(function(v, k)  {\n      if (notAssociative ? !a.has(v) :\n          flipped ? !is(v, a.get(k, NOT_SET)) : !is(a.get(k, NOT_SET), v)) {\n        allEqual = false;\n        return false;\n      }\n    });\n\n    return allEqual && a.size === bSize;\n  }\n\n  createClass(Repeat, IndexedSeq);\n\n    function Repeat(value, times) {\n      if (!(this instanceof Repeat)) {\n        return new Repeat(value, times);\n      }\n      this._value = value;\n      this.size = times === undefined ?

Multiple advantages for this particular use case.\n * In short, we need identical functionality to setState(), unless there is a prop defined\n * for the state key.  Also:\n *\n * 1. Single Renders\n *    Calling trySetState() in constructor(), componentWillMount(), or componentWillReceiveProps()\n *    does not cause two renders. Consumers and tests do not have to wait two renders to get state.\n *    See www.react.run/4kJFdKoxb/27 for an example of this issue.\n *\n * 2. Simple Testing\n *    Using a HOC means you must either test the undecorated component or test through the decorator.\n *    Testing the undecorated component means you must mock the decorator functionality.\n *    Testing through the HOC means you can not simply shallow render your component.\n *\n * 3. Statics\n *    HOC wrap instances, so statics are no longer accessible.  They can be hoisted, but this is more\n *    looping over properties and storing references.  We rely heavily on statics for testing and sub\n *    components.\n *\n * 4. Instance Methods\n *    Some instance methods may be exposed to users via refs.  Again, these are lost with HOC unless\n *    hoisted and exposed by the HOC.\n */\n\n\nvar getDefaultPropName = function getDefaultPropName(prop) {\n  return 'default' + (prop[0].toUpperCase() + prop.slice(1));\n};\n\nvar AutoControlledComponent = function (_Component) {\n  _inherits(AutoControlledComponent, _Component);\n\n  function AutoControlledComponent() {\n    var _ref;\n\n    var _temp, _this, _ret;\n\n    _classCallCheck(this, AutoControlledComponent);\n\n    for (var _len = arguments.length, args = Array(_len), _key = 0; _key < _len; _key++) {\n      args[_key] = arguments[_key];\n    }\n\n    return _ret = (_temp = (_this = _possibleConstructorReturn(this, (_ref = AutoControlledComponent.__proto__ || Object.getPrototypeOf(AutoControlledComponent)).call.apply(_ref, [this].concat(args))), _this), _this.trySetState = function (maybeState, state) {\n      var autoControlledProps = _this.constructor.autoControlledProps;\n\n      if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {\n        var name = _this.constructor.name;\n        // warn about failed attempts to setState for keys not listed in autoControlledProps\n\n        var illegalKeys = (0, _difference3.default)((0, _keys3.default)(maybeState), autoControlledProps);\n        if (!(0, _isEmpty3.default)(illegalKeys)) {\n          console.error([name + ' called trySetState() with controlled props: \"' + illegalKeys + '\".', 'State will not be set.', 'Only props in static autoControlledProps will be set on state.'].join(' '));\n        }\n      }\n\n      // pick auto controlled props\n      // omit props from parent\n      var newState = (0, _omit3.default)((0, _pick3.default)(maybeState, autoControlledProps), (0, _keys3.default)(_this.props));\n\n      if (state) newState = _extends({}, newState, state);\n\n      if (!(0, _isEmpty3.default)(newState)) _this.setState(newState);\n    }, _temp), _possibleConstructorReturn(_this, _ret);\n  }\n\n  _createClass(AutoControlledComponent, [{\n    key: 'componentWillMount',\n    value: function componentWillMount() {\n      var _this2 = this;\n\n      if (_get(AutoControlledComponent.prototype.__proto__ || Object.getPrototypeOf(AutoControlledComponent.prototype), 'componentWillMount', this)) _get(AutoControlledComponent.prototype.__proto__ || Object.getPrototypeOf(AutoControlledComponent.prototype), 'componentWillMount', this).call(this);\n      var autoControlledProps = this.constructor.autoControlledProps;\n\n      // Auto controlled props are copied to state.\n      // Set initial state by copying auto controlled props to state.\n      // Also look for the default prop for any auto controlled props (foo => defaultFoo)\n      // so we can set initial values from defaults.\n\n      this.state = (0, _transform3.default)(autoControlledProps, function (res, prop) {\n        var defaultPropName = getDefaultPropName(prop);\n\n        // try to set initial state in this order:\n        //  - default props\n        //  - then, regular props\n        //  - then, `checked` defaults to false\n        //  - then, `value` defaults to null\n        // React doesn't allow changing from uncontrolled to controlled components\n        // this is why we default checked/value if they are not present.\n        if ((0, _has3.default)(_this2.props, defaultPropName)) {\n          res[prop] = _this2.props[defaultPropName];\n        } else if ((0, _has3.default)(_this2.props, prop)) {\n          res[prop] = _this2.props[prop];\n        } else if (prop === 'checked') {\n          res[prop] = false;\n        } else if (prop === 'value') {\n          res[prop] = _this2.props.multiple ?
